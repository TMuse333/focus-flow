header1: "How to plan a website for maximum success"
description1: "In todays competitive world, we want to ensure that any client we work with will have 
the highest probability of success. This means 
we have to know what does the client want the website
to do for them, what does the user have to see and feel so that they do the desired action and then
what points of leverage does the client have so
the web developer can display those points of
leverage on the website so the user does the 
desired action, that's essentially what our
websites do. \n\n
This process is essential because
it defines clear expectations for each party and
gives confidence that we are doing the best possible moves available to ensure success. It also greatly 
speeds up the development process as no energy or time is wasted deciding on what to do. To give an example of this, I'll now go over the development
process of this particular website, FocusFlow Software."

  are multiple things that we do. First we let the user know that websites can have a very positive effect (more clients, time saved, ect) on their business via a website. The second task is making the user think there is a high probability that a
  website will actually do the things we say it will.
  The next two components to our offer is that we can do it quickly and it will take minimal effort
